# Git on Mac

I an investigating how to support automatic authentication for two different GitHub logins.

## Apple's forked version of Git

Apple maintains their own version of Git for deployment on their machines. One of the things this does is force include a `gitconfig` file. (located at `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/share/git-core/gitconfig`)

```bash
$ git --version
# git version 2.24.3 (Apple Git-128)
```

This config sets the `credential.helper` field to `osxkeychain` to use the built in OSX keychain helper.

Normally this would be fine for a single GitHub login across your whole system, but there is no way to override this.

A suggestion is to use Homebrew to install normal `git` which will use any config scheme you ask for.

```bash
$ brew install git
# brew install output omitted

# open a new shell
$ git --version
git version 2.29.2
```

Then you can use split Config files to access different credential sources.

This lets you use a different config file based on directory.

# Alternatives

You can simply pass the "useHttpPath" to the `osxkeychain` helper so that it matches each full URL. This means you need to enter your password for each repository.

This isn't idea, especially because 2-factor auth requires a PAT instead of a password. So it is hard to remember the password.
