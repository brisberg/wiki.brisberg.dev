# Welcome to wiki.brisberg.dev Wiki!

### Improvements
Hugo-Book comes with an `auto` theme selection where it will select a white/dark theme based on OS preferences. This is nice, but it would be a bit better to give the user control.

I could integrate a `light/dark theme toggle` similar to the toggle in [zDoc](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-zdoc/)

This could even include local storage, but possibly session storage would be better so it will be overwritten by OS prefs each reload.
