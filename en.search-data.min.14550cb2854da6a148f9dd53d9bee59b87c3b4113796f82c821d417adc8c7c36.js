Or you can layer your changes on top of an existing theme.\nHugo makes a bunch of assumptions about the structure of your site, as all of your content pages will be under the content/ directory. Depending on which subdirectory you choose it will interpret the content type. You can override this with a Front Matter, basically a YAML block at the top of the markdown file which Hugo will use when generating. The Front Matter can override most things.\nIt is useful to examine the theme for which layouts / config params it is looking for. These isn\u0026rsquo;t a clean declaration of all the options available. See variables docs for existing builtin Hugo variables at the Site and Page level.\nSome useful ones:\n Type: Override the inferred content type, meaning you can use a different template Slug: Override the url slug used (default is the file name). E.x. /pages/apps-slug. Url: Override the url from the site root to this page. E.x. /pages/apps -\u0026gt; /apps. This can create circular references so be careful.

Others have already summarized the it better than I can.\nAnatomy of a URL #  The important thing for understanding Web Hosting is how browsers and routers translate a URL into a concrete destination server. A URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator; meaning it is a Universal identifier to Locate a Resource on the internet.\nURLs are made up of several component parts, each of which has a specific meaning:\nImage from Doepud Web Design See this excellent write-up for details about all URL components, but for setting up Web Hosting we are mainly concerned with the following:\n Top-level Domain - TLDs are the highest level divisions in the Domain Name System. These domains are usually mained by International Organizations and include common domains like .com, .org, .gov, as well as more specialized domains like .fr, .jp, and Google\u0026rsquo;s .dev. Domain Name - Domain names are specific domains within a Top-level Domain and are usually owned by a single entity. For examlpe google.com is the domain name for Google Inc. under the .com top-level domain. Subdomain - Subdomains are named domains within a particular Domain Name. For example maps.google.com specifies the maps subdomain under the google.com domain. www is the default subdomain for all domains and can often be omitted when entering a URL.  Purchase a Domain Name #  When an end user wants to register a new website location with the DNS, they will usually purchase a Domain Name from a Registrar.\nTop-level Domains are specified by international organizations and are not available for ownership by any business entity.\nDomain names can be purchased on a monthly or yearly basis and no other user can claim that Domain in the mean time.\nOnce you own a Domain Name, you can also supply an unlimited number of Subdomains for any purpose.\nThere are a large number of DNS Registrars from which you can purchase domains. These are some of the most popular:\n Google Domains Wix.com GoDaddy namecheap  My best experience so far is with Google Domains, as they usually had lower prices on many domains. Google is the only provider of their new TLDs .dev and .page.\n"});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/docs/version-control/git/git-on-mac/','title':"Git on Mac",'section':"Git",'content':"Git on Mac #  I an investigating how to support automatic authentication for two different GitHub logins.\nApple\u0026rsquo;s forked version of Git #  Apple maintains their own version of Git for deployment on their machines.
