# Web Domains

[How the internet works](https://medium.com/@User3141592/how-does-the-internet-work-edc2e22e7eb8) is a broad and very technical topic which involves everything from Internet Protocols to Routing Tables. Others have already summarized the it better than I can.

## Anatomy of a URL

The important thing for understanding Web Hosting is how browsers and routers translate a URL into a concrete destination server. A URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator; meaning it is a ***Universal*** identifier to ***Locate*** a ***Resource*** on the internet.

URLs are made up of several component parts, each of which has a specific meaning:

See this excellent [write-up](https://doepud.co.uk/blog/anatomy-of-a-url) for details about all URL components, but for setting up Web Hosting we are mainly concerned with the following:

- [Top-level Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain) - TLDs are the highest level divisions in the Domain Name System. These domains are usually mained by International Organizations and include common domains like `.com`, `.org`, `.gov`, as well as more specialized domains like `.fr`, `.jp`, and Google's `.dev`.
- [Domain Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name) - Domain names are specific domains within a Top-level Domain and are usually owned by a single entity. For examlpe `google.com` is the domain name for Google Inc. under the `.com` top-level domain.
- [Subdomain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain) - Subdomains are named domains within a particular Domain Name. For example `maps.google.com` specifies the `maps` subdomain under the `google.com` domain. `www` is the default subdomain for all domains and can often be omitted when entering a URL.

## Purchase a Domain Name

When an end user wants to register a new website location with the DNS, they will usually purchase a Domain Name from a Registrar.

Top-level Domains are specified by international organizations and are not available for ownership by any business entity.

Domain names can be purchased on a monthly or yearly basis and no other user can claim that Domain in the mean time.

Once you own a Domain Name, you can also supply an unlimited number of Subdomains for any purpose.

There are a large number of DNS Registrars from which you can purchase domains. These are some of the most popular:

- [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com)
- [Wix.com](https://www.wix.com/)
- [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/)
- [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)

My best experience so far is with Google Domains, as they usually had lower prices on many domains. Google is the only provider of their new TLDs `.dev` and `.page`.
